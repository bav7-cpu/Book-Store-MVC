# Book-Store-MVC

An MVC architectural approach was used with full CRUD functionality for a book list.

To deploy the MVC you must click on Java Resources > scr/main/java > controller package and select “BooksController”. Once on this controller, click “run”.

tomcat version 9 is required to run the MVC application.
Java 17 SE was used to create both applications.
